# CourseMonitor

CourseMonitor is a tool designed to help students monitor course availability in real time. Many popular courses fill up quickly, making it difficult for students to enroll. With CourseMonitor, you can receive instant notifications when a spot becomes available, allowing you to register as soon as possible.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously checks the status of selected courses.
- **Instant Notifications:** Notifies users immediately when a course has an open spot.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple setup and configuration.

## Use Case

If a course you want is full, CourseMonitor will keep watching for any openings (for example, if someone drops the course). As soon as a spot becomes available, you'll be notified right away, giving you the best chance to enroll.
